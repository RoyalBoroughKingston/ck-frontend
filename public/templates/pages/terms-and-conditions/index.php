                <p>Welcome to connectedkingston.uk (referred to in this page as “<strong>Connected Kingston”</strong>, "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>") and our curated list of locally available Services and Activities (referred to in this page as "<strong>services</strong>"). This site has been created for adult (over 18) residents of the London borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. By accessing our site and making a referral you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions and our terms of use policy.</p>
				
				<p>This page (together with the documents referred to on it) outlines the terms and conditions on which we and our partners offer services to you. Please read these terms and conditions carefully before making a referral from our site. If you have any questions relating to these terms and conditions please contact <a href="mailto:info@connectedkingston.uk">info@connectedkingston.uk</a> before you make a referral. If you do not accept these terms and conditions in full please do not use our site.</p>
				
				<p>If you have a emergency, you should seek immediate advice from an emergency service or if you have any other problem that requires urgent attention you should seek independent advice or another form of assistance away from this site. This site is aimed at connecting people to their community not for any urgent assistance.</p>
				
				<h3>1. Referrals</h3>
				
				<p>When you make a referral through <strong>Connected Kingston</strong>, it will be sent to the Service Provider. The Service Provider ("<strong>provider</strong>") will then make contact with you. All <strong>providers</strong> that take referrals through <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> have signed an agreement that they will try to make contact with that individual within ten working days. If <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> becomes aware that a <strong>provider</strong> is not able to respond within that time frame, we will take off the referral capability for that service. If you feel a referral has not been accepted within the required timescale or if you experience any issues of concern arising from a referral please email <a href="mailto:info@connectedkingston.uk">info@connectedkingston.uk</a></p>
				
				<p>If you make a referral through <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> only the referral provider and <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> will make contact with you, or on occasion you may be asked to complete a survey by <strong>Connected Kingston</strong>. <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> will never make unsolicited calls or emails to you, nor share any personal referral information with anyone except the <strong>Provider</strong> without your express permission.</p>
				
				<h3>2. Non-Referral Services</h3>
				
				<p>Our site may also include links to other services that we think may be of assistance to residents. These services are notable due to their not having a referral option on their page or merely being links within a page. <strong>Connected Kingston</strong> endeavours to maintain these pages and/or links but we cannot make any promises as to their suitability or their capacity to undertake referrals, time scales for referrals or any other form of promise as to their ability to assist. We have no control over them or their agents.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Connected Kingston</strong> place theses <strong>services</strong> on these pages to be used in the form of a directory, this may be because we may have used them in the past or they have requested to be on the site. The aim is to make it easier for residents to find services that exist. We do not place them as an endorsement of them and no implication should be drawn that we feel they are better than any other competitor organisation. If you would like to be included on the site please contact <a href="mailto:info@connectedkingston.uk">info@connectedkingston.uk</a> </p>
